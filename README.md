# BTSMCQ (Mini Javascript Project) 
This is my first project on Github: JavaScript MCQ for those that want to embark on MCQ project.

**BTSMCQ** is an advanced JavaScript App project designed for users working on multiple-choice question (MCQ) assessments. Developed in **Full-Stack JavaScript**, it offers a seamless experience for managing examinations with intuitive functionality. Users can navigate through questions using a **'Next'** button to proceed and a **'Previous'** button to review attempted questions. The system includes a **'Finish'** button for submission upon completion of the exam.

### Additional features of BTSMCQ: 
* Countdown timer to keep track of examination duration. 
* Intelligently randomizes both questions and answer options for a dynamic testing experience. 
* Automatic halts the examination and generates a score If timer elapsed before the user finishes the exam.

This project serves as an excellent foundation for individuals building MCQ-based applications.
